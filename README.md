# boron_cipher
An implementation of Boron Cipher, a compact encryption algorithm designed for hardware.

Boron cipher is designed to provide safe data traversals. It encompasses non-linear and linear stages 
enabling cryptological complexity in a small footprint, making it suitable to embed in hardware 
designs.
